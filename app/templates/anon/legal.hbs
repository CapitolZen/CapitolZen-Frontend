      <h3>
        Accuracy of Data
      </h3>
      <p>
        Capitol Zen acquires state data through third party sources. While Capitol
        Zen makes its best effort to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the
        data, Capitol Zen shall not be held liable for any problems with the
        underlying data, including, but not limited to: incomplete, missing, or
        inaccurate records.
      </p>
      <p>
        THE STATE DATA IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS
        OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
        FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Customer Obligations
      </h3>
      <p>
        Administration of Customer’s Account. Customer may specify one or more
        administrators (each an “Administrator”) to manage its account.
        Administrators have the ability to access, monitor, use, export and
        disclose all content posted by End Users in accordance with applicable
        local laws. Customer is responsible for: (i) the selection of its
        Administrator(s); (ii) maintaining the confidentiality of passwords and
        Administrator accounts; (iii) managing access to Administrator accounts;
        and (iv) ensuring that each Administrator’s use of the Service complies
        with this Subscriber Agreement. Capitol Zen shall not be held liable for
        any actions on the part of Customer’s Administrator(s).
      </p>
      <p>
        End User Conduct; Compliance. Customer is responsible for use of the
        Service by its End Users and for their compliance with Capitol Zen’s User
        Terms of Service. Customer is also responsible for providing any notice and
        obtaining any consents and authorizations necessary: (i) to allow the
        Administrator to access, monitor, use, and disclose the content posted by
        the End Users on the Service; and (ii) to allow Capitol Zen to provide the
        Administrator with access to such End User content. The Service is not
        authorized for use by persons under the age of 13 and Customer will ensure
        that it does not allow any person under 13 to use the Service. Customer
        will promptly notify Capitol Zen if it becomes aware of any unauthorized
        access to Customer’s account or the Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Restrictions. Customer will not: (i) rent, sell, resell or lease the
        Service to any third party; (ii) use the Service for any purpose where
        either the use or the failure of the Service might lead to personal injury,
        death or physical damage; or (ii) disassemble, decompile or reverse
        engineer the Service or attempt or assist anyone else to do so, unless such
        restriction is prohibited by law.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suspension. Capitol Zen may request that Customer suspend the account of
        any End User who: (i) violates the User Terms of Service; or (ii) is using
        the Service in a manner that Capitol Zen reasonably believes may cause a
        security risk, a disruption to others’ use of the Service, or liability for
        Capitol Zen. If Customer fails to promptly suspend or terminate such End
        User’s account, Capitol Zen reserves the right to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        Customer’s Use of Third Party Services. Capitol Zen does not warrant or
        support any third party service (e.g., a service that utilizes the Capitol
        Zen API in connection with Customer’s use of the Service) and will not be
        responsible for any act or omission on the part of such third party or its
        service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Capitol Zen reserves the right to suspend, modify, or terminate the
        Customer’s account and all of the associated End Users, as well as
        permanently delete all records associated with the Customer.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Intellectual Property Rights.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Limited License to Use Customer Content. Customer hereby grants to Capitol
        Zen a limited, nonexclusive and nontransferable (except in connection with
        the sale or transfer of its business) license to access, use, copy,
        reproduce, process, adapt, publish, transmit and display the Customer Data
        for the limited purpose of (i) providing the Service and associated
        customer support to Customer; (ii) displaying the Customer Data to the End
        Users; and (iii) analyzing and improving the Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reservation of Rights. Except as expressly set forth herein, this
        Subscriber Agreement does not (i) grant Capitol Zen any rights or interest
        in or to the Customer Data or any Customer Intellectual Property; or (ii)
        grant Customer any rights or interest in or to the Service or any Capitol
        Zen Intellectual Property. For purposes hereof, the term “Intellectual
        Property” shall mean any current or future worldwide rights under any
        patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret; any moral rights or any
        similar rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use of Customer Suggestions. Capitol Zen may incorporate into the Service
        any suggestions or feedback received from Customer without any obligation
        to Customer and any such modifications to the Service shall be the sole and
        exclusive property of Capitol Zen. Capitol Zen may also share and publish
        aggregate, anonymized data about the use of our Service by our customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Capitol Zen Customer List. Capitol Zen may include Customer’s name in a
        list of Capitol Zen’s Customers online and in print and electronic
        marketing materials.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fees and Payment. By subscribing to the Service and providing payment
        account information, Customer agrees to these payment terms and conditions.
        If Customer subscribes to the Service under any promotional subscription
        fee, some additional restrictions may apply. These restrictions, if any,
        will be provided to Customer before Customer signs up for the Service that
        is subject to the promotion. Free or discounted introductory offers are
        only available to new users of the Service, except where expressly stated.
        Fees are non-refundable except as required by law or as explicitly set
        forth herein. Customer will pay all applicable fees when due and, if such
        fees are being paid via credit card or other electronic means, Customer
        authorizes Capitol Zen to charge such fees using Customer’s selected
        payment method. By default, customer accounts are set to auto-renew and
        require recurring payments. Fees will be charged on an annual or monthly
        basis based on Customer’s subscription. Capitol Zen may automatically
        charge Customer for such renewal on or after the renewal date associated
        with Customer’s account unless Customer has terminated the Service or
        Capitol Zen terminates the Service. Customer must cancel the Service prior
        to its renewal date in order to avoid billing of the next period’s fee. If
        Customer chooses to cancel the Service, Customer may use the Service until
        the end of the current period but will not be issued a refund for the most
        recently (or any previously) charged fees. Customer can cancel Service
        anytime online by going into the Customer’s account settings prior to its
        renewal date if Customer has a monthly plan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Capitol Zen may revise fee rates and/or the billable amount structure for
        the Service from time to time and will provide Customer’s designated
        administrator(s) with email notice of any changes in fees at least thirty
        (30) days prior. Customer is responsible for providing complete and
        accurate billing information to Capitol Zen. Customer will be billed for
        the appropriate plan based on the total number of unique users, including
        those with limited access. Capitol Zen may suspend or terminate Customer’s
        use of the Service if fees become past due. Customer is responsible for all
        taxes (excluding taxes on Capitol Zen’s net income) and Capitol Zen will
        charge tax when required to do so by law.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Indemnification.
      </h3>
      <p>
        By Customer. Customer hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless
        Capitol Zen, its licensees and licensors, and their respective employees,
        contractors, agents, officers and directors (together, the “Capitol Zen
        Affiliates”), from and against any and all liabilities, damages,
        obligations, losses, costs and expenses (including but not limited to
        reasonable attorney’s fees) (together, the “Losses”) arising from or as a
        result of any claim by a third party against Capitol Zen or the Capitol Zen
        Affiliates regarding: (i) use of or access to the Service by Customer or
        its End Users in violation of this Subscriber Agreement or our User Terms
        of Service; or (ii) any data or Customer Data transmitted or received
        through, or posted or stored in, Customer’s account.
      </p>
      <p>
        By Capitol Zen. Capitol Zen hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold
        harmless Customer and its employees, contractors, agents, officers and
        directors (together the “Customer Affiliates”), from and against any and
        all Losses arising from or as a result of any claim by a third party
        against Customer or the Customer Affiliates to the extent based on an
        allegation that the Service or Capitol Zen’s technology used to provide the
        Service infringes or misappropriates any copyright, trade secret, U.S.
        patent, or trademark right of the third party. In no event will Capitol Zen
        have any obligations or liability under this section arising from: (i) use
        of the Service in a modified form or in combination with materials not
        furnished by Capitol Zen; (ii) use of any third party app developed using
        Capitol Zen’s API; or (iii) any content, information, or data provided by
        Customer, End Users, or other third parties. THIS INDEMNITY IS CUSTOMER’S
        ONLY REMEDY UNDER THIS SUBSCRIBER AGREEMENT FOR ANY VIOLATION BY Capitol
        Zen OF ANY THIRD PARTY’S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Infringement Claims. If the Service becomes, or in Capitol Zen’s reasonable
        judgment is likely to become, the subject of a claim of infringement, then
        Capitol Zen may: (i) obtain the right, at Capitol Zen’s expense, for
        Customer to continue using the Service; (ii) provide a non-infringing
        functionally equivalent replacement; (iii) modify the Service so that it is
        no longer infringing. If Capitol Zen, in its sole and reasonable judgment,
        determines that none of the above options are commercially reasonable, then
        Capitol Zen may suspend or terminate Customer’s use of the Service and
        provide Customer with a pro rata refund of prepaid fees.
      </p>
      <p>
        Process. The party seeking indemnification will provide prompt notice
        concerning the existence of an indemnifiable claim and cooperate fully with
        the indemnifying party in defending the claim. Failure to give prompt
        notice shall not constitute a waiver of a party’s right to indemnification
        and shall affect the indemnifying party’s obligations hereunder only to the
        extent that the indemnifying party’s rights are materially prejudiced by
        such failure or delay. The indemnifying party will have full control and
        authority over the defense of any claim; provided, however, that: (i) the
        indemnified party may join in the defense at its own expense using counsel
        of its choice; and (ii) any settlement requiring the party seeking
        indemnification to admit liability or make any financial payment will
        require such party’s prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld
        or delayed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Limitation of Liability. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
        EXCEPT IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS
        HEREUNDER, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY OR THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES,
        AGENTS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES OR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE UNDER THIS SUBSCRIBER
        AGREEMENT FOR (I) ANY INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
        CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES; OR (II) LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS
        REVENUES, PROFITS (IN EACH CASE WHETHER DIRECT OR INDIRECT), GOODWILL, OR
        OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL Capitol Zen BE
        RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE, LOSS OR INJURY RESULTING FROM HACKING,
        TAMPERING OR OTHER UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR USE OF THE SERVICE OR CUSTOMER’S
        ACCOUNT OR THE INFORMATION CONTAINED THEREIN BY ANY THIRD PARTY. THESE
        LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SHALL APPLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER A PARTY KNEW OR
        SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT SUCH DAMAGES WERE POSSIBLE AND EVEN IF A REMEDY
        FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. EXCEPT IN CONNECTION WITH ITS
        INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER, IN NO EVENT SHALL Capitol Zen BE
        LIABLE TO CUSTOMER FOR ANY CLAIMS, PROCEEDINGS, LIABILITIES, OBLIGATIONS,
        DAMAGES, LOSSES OR COSTS IN AN AMOUNT EXCEEDING THE AMOUNT PAID BY CUSTOMER
        TO Capitol Zen HEREUNDER DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT
        GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hosting of the Service; Export Restrictions. The Service is controlled and
        operated from facilities in the United States. Capitol Zen makes no
        representations that the Service is appropriate or available for use in
        other locations. Customers who access or use the Service from other
        jurisdictions (or who allow their End Users to do so) do so of their own
        volition and are responsible for compliance with all applicable United
        States and local laws and regulations, including but not limited to export
        and import regulations. If Customer is located outside of the United
        States, Customer agrees that Capitol Zen may transfer, store and process
        Customer Data in locations other than Customer’s country. Capitol Zen
        complies with the U.S. – E.U. Privacy Shield Framework and the U.S. – Swiss
        Privacy Shield framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce
        regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from European
        Union member countries and Switzerland. To learn more about the Privacy
        Shield program and to view Capitol Zen’s Privacy Shield certification,
        please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov. The export and re-export of
        Content via the Service may be controlled by the United States Export
        Administration Regulations or other applicable export restrictions or
        embargo. The Service may not be used in any country that is subject to an
        embargo by the United States and Customer may not use the Service in
        violation of any export restriction or embargo by the United States or any
        other applicable jurisdiction. In addition, Customer must ensure that the
        Service is not made available for use by persons or entities blocked or
        denied by the United States government.
      </p>
      <p>
        Modifications. Capitol Zen may revise this Subscriber Agreement from time
        to time by posting the modified version on its website at least twenty (20)
        days prior to the effective date of the modifications being made; provided,
        however, that no such modification shall include a reduction in Customer’s
        rights or Capitol Zen’s obligations unless affirmatively agreed to by
        Customer in advance. If, in Capitol Zen’s sole and reasonable discretion,
        the modifications being proposed are material, Capitol Zen will notify
        Customer of such proposed modifications via email to the email address
        associated with Customer’s account. By continuing to access or use the
        Service after the posted effective date of modifications to this Subscriber
        Agreement that do not include a reduction in Customer’s rights or Capitol
        Zen’s obligations hereunder, Customer agrees to be bound by such
        modifications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Governing Law; Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver. PLEASE READ
        THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT
        TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Subscriber Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of
        Michigan without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. The application
        of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
        Goods is expressly excluded.
      </p>
      <p>
        Claims relating to this Agreement or the Service will be resolved through
        final and binding arbitration, except as set forth below. The parties agree
        that the Subscriber Agreement affects interstate commerce and that the
        Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these
        arbitration provisions. Initial Dispute Resolution: The parties agree that
        most disputes can be resolved without resort to litigation. The parties
        agree to use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or
        disagreement directly through consultation with each other, and good faith
        negotiations shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or
        arbitration. Accordingly, before initiating a lawsuit or arbitration,
        Customer Agrees to contact Capitol Zen to attempt to resolve the dispute in
        good faith. Binding Arbitration &amp; Class Action Waiver: If the parties
        do not reach an agreed-upon solution within a period of thirty (30) days
        from the time the informal dispute resolution is initiated under the
        Initial Dispute Resolution provision above, then either party may initiate
        binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to the
        terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating
        to the Agreement (including its formation, performance and breach), the
        parties’ relationship with each other and/or your use of the Services shall
        be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by the American
        Arbitration Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rules, excluding
        any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. Thus, THE
        PARTIES AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN ITS
        INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY
        PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator
        determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void
        or unenforceable for any reason or that arbitration can proceed on a class
        basis, then the disputes, claims or controversies will not be subject to
        arbitration and must be litigated in state or federal court located in San
        Francisco, California. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local
        court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes
        arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability,
        enforceability or formation of the Subscriber Agreement, including, but not
        limited to any claim that all or any part of the Subscriber Agreement is
        void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration. The
        arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available
        in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be written,
        and binding on the Parties and judgment on the award rendered by the
        arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
        Arbitration will be held in San Francisco, California. If any court or
        arbitrator determines that this arbitration provision is void or
        unenforceable for any reason or that the parties are not bound to arbitrate
        their claims, then the disputes, claims or controversies deemed not to be
        subject to arbitration must be litigated in state or federal court located
        in San Francisco, California. Exception: Litigation of Intellectual
        Property Claims: Notwithstanding the foregoing, disputes, claims, or
        controversies concerning (1) either party’s patents, copyrights, moral
        rights, trademarks, and trade secrets or (2) claims of piracy or
        unauthorized use of the Services (collectively, “IP Claims”) shall not be
        subject to arbitration.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Miscellaneous
      </h3>
      <p>
        Relationship of the Parties. The parties are and shall be independent
        contractors with respect to all services provided under this Subscriber
        Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Force Majeure. Except for payment obligations, neither Capitol Zen nor
        Customer will be liable for inadequate performance to the extent caused by
        a condition that is beyond the party’s reasonable control, including but
        not limited to natural disaster, civil disturbance, acts of terrorism or
        war, labor conditions, governmental actions and interruption or failure of
        the Internet or any utility service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Assignment. Neither this Subscriber Agreement nor any of the rights and
        licenses granted hereunder, may be transferred or assigned by either party
        without the other party’s express written consent; provided, however, that
        either party may assign this Subscriber Agreement without the other party’s
        consent to an affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition,
        corporate reorganization or sale of all or substantially all of its assets.
        Any other attempt to transfer or assign this Subscriber Agreement will be
        null and void.
      </p>
      <p>
        Entire Agreement. This Subscriber Agreement, together with any Customer
        purchase order or order form associated herewith (as limited by Section 6),
        constitutes the entire agreement of the parties concerning the subject
        matter hereof and supersedes and replaces any prior or contemporaneous
        understandings and agreements, whether written or oral, with respect to the
        subject matter hereof. If a court of competent jurisdiction deems any
        provision of this Subscriber Agreement invalid, the invalidity of such
        provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions hereof,
        which shall remain in full force and effect
      </p>
      <p>
        No Waiver. No waiver of any term of this Subscriber Agreement shall be
        deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and a
        party’s failure to assert any right or provision under this Subscriber
        Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
